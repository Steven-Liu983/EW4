    <h2>Rise of America (1775-1822)</h2>
    <ol>                <!-- An ordered list -->
        <li>American Revolution I</li>
        <p>Defend with Greene and one of your generals up north. Send everyone else to attack Duckworth, then turn north and kill the enemies as they come. Brock might not move so you need to assault him at the end.</p>
        <li>American Revolution II</li>
        <p>The trick is to defend the waves of the British forces. Use your artillery general on the strong generals, spam light infantry, and slaughter all the enemy troops with your cavalry general. The enemy does not attack all at once, but separately, making it easy to defend. After bombing the enemy generals, just bomb Wilmington. With a few turns of good defense, the British should be greatly weakened.</p>
        <li>American Revolution III</li>
        <p>The North is where most of your fighting is going to happen so assign Kate to the ship there along with Murat on the heavy cavalry and Sophia on the heavy artillery. South: Your allies will actually help here so just wait for them to charge in and weaken all of the enemies there before you go in. You can capture the city south of the objective. Washington isn't that important for surviving. That's pretty much all that's going to happen down there. If Davout still has health he can help out the North. North: After a few turns one of the British generals is going to attack, make sure to guard Sophia. Kate is going to harass the coastline by destroying the fort and taking potshots at the enemies. With Murat it shouldn't be that big of an issue to overpower the enemy units. Cornplanter shouldn't even be part of the battle unless he goes for the southern area.</p>
        <li>Great Sea Warfare</li>
        <p>Upgrade Charleston & St Augustine, move Jackson to Charleston to boost income. Use Jackson to trade food and metal for gold to upgrade other cities. Assign Kate to St Augustine frigate, move up to Savannah to defend the coastline. Assign generals to the heavy artillery, grenadiers, line infantry, light cavalry and light artillery. The light artillery, light cavalry and line infantry will defend St Augustine. Heavy artillery, grenadier will help defend Charleston & Wilmington. Park Kate in Charleston port, use the coastal forts to defend the port. If your coastal forts are destroyed, build new ones. When you have more money, build battleships in the two ports that you have. You might have to move land units into the sea to hit back at the enemies. Remember to flank and use the armored carrier. Need to use a lot of defensive items as well as healing tents. All the French generals will attempt to rush your positions towards the end. You need to kill off all the French near St Augustine early, so send the St Augustine defenders to help out at Charleston.</p>
        <li>Westward Movement*</li>
        <p>The key is to have extremely fast generals, accomplished by either move trainers or items. With fast generals, you can beat down Karamanli with 3-4 generals in 1-2 rounds or so. Defend against Huarte with Zebulon, instead of milita. Leave the town open for the British, as the moment they start moving, you can swiftly move my generals to aid built militia against the British. Once you beat the British, you can then swiftly rush Cornplanter.</p>
        <li>Second War of Independence</li>
        <p>The heavy cavalry and light infantry should take Montreal then move south towards Kingston. Greene's force should go straight for Duckworth. Kill him then head for Fort York. Your heavy artillery will head straight for Cleveland. Don't bother with Detroit, the forces there won't come south. Mercer will head East towards the large fortress by mid-game. Will be good to equip a general with 5 stars in trading here so that you can trade your metal and food for gold when you take the city. Upgrade whatever that are available to boost your economy. Dearborn's force will help out at Cleveland for a few turns, then head up towards Fort York. Stay clear of the large fortress and the frigate. Brock will sit in the city and not move, so bombard him. Prevost with the siege artillery will sit there and not move. Get up close and personal with him so that he cannot fire on you.</p>
        <li>Revenge of the British</li>
        <p>The British in the north are going to attack your units there immediately. Have them retreat around the west. It will distract them and allow your generals to attack. Focus on the enemy generals while leaving Dearborn in a city for a few turns. He has the Architecture skill and can upgrade cities for half price. After the attacking enemy generals are killed, capture Washington, as it will give you high morale. Try to ignore the coast until you have Washington secured. The navy general will be the hardest to kill. Just don't let him get free shots at your soldiers near the coast. Kill Picton before trying to fight him. Provided that your generals are still alive and healthy you should be able to beat the enemy navy, then capture the port.</p>
        <li>Unified North America</li>
        <p>Play defensive at Montreal and Fort York. At Montreal, try to defend the city with cheap unit. Line infantry is a good one. There, you have a fort to help attacking and you can build artillery for additional fire power. Move Jackson to Montreal and let him sit in there defending. Also, upgrade the town so that you will earn a lot more resources from Jackson's Economic Master. You may either leave small towns south of Montreal or use cheap unit to defend them. These towns produce little resources, not worth the cost of defending them but they might buy you some time. At Fort York, utilize the small fort and bottleneck there for the defense. You can use one unit to stand next to the fort, blocking the advancing Indians, and have rocket launcher to fire from the rear. Once you kill the enemies attacking Fort York, including Graham, go take the factory in the northeast and then Kingston. It is worth building some artillery here for taking Kingston and killing Paget. If you kill all the land units around Kingston, you may just leave the ships and fort the alone so your troops do not unnecessarily get any damage. The town can be left unguarded. Sometimes around here, Paget will come approaching you, just attack him with artillery. Then from Montreal, split your troops into two, send one to join force with those from Kingston to take the town in the north, and the rest to capture Quebec. Indian general, Cornplanter, might either join the fight in the north or near Quebec. Whichever the case, it will be more troublesome there. So send more troops to where he is. Prevost will come down to fight so if Cornplanter also goes help in the north, then it will be a real trouble since you will face 3 enemy generals; Rowland, Prevost , and Cornplanter. You either have to attack the northern town quickly before that happens or simply use brute force and artillery. You can send a group of cavalries to take the last Indian town in the north to quickly finish the mission so that you don't have to eliminate all enemy generals and forts (except Cornplanter).</p>
        <li>March on Britain*</li>
        <p>Divided your forces into two: Jackson, light artillery with a general, frigate will move east, bombard then kill the line infantry then head towards Glasgow. Take care to avoid fire from the fort, the coastal fort; frigate fire from Edinburgh. After you take Glasgow, defend it with a cheap unit from the enemy forces from Elgin. Main force should proceed to Leeds then meet up with the other force at Liverpool. Heavy cavalry with a general, machine gun with a general (Hull); light cavalry with a general will land around the trading port. Assign a general to one of the frigate; bombard the enemy land forces to weaken them before your land troops arrive to take Dublin. When there is no more land forces, you can move all your land forces east to land and meet up at Liverpool. Use the flanking method to destroy 5 ships. Jervis is hard but you will get him. After you are done, move the 3 ships to capture the port above Plymouth together with the frigate which assisted with the Glasgow attack. Fire onto the battleship from afar. Use a land unit to flank with your privateer, then your other 3 frigate will fire on it. Both forces will assemble at Liverpool then use your machine gun. Make a double rocket with a general from the factory at Leeds, move it towards London. Don’t forget to protect it from the fortress and heavy artillery fire. The double rocket with a general would smash everyone to bits there.</p>
        <li>Peninsula Landings</li>
        <p>Put your artillery general on the rocket, your navy-hybrid on the heavy ship, your cavalry on the guards cavalry and whatever else you got in the best troop available. Move all your ships to the right flank before you attack and the land troops near Lacoruna while you destroy the coastal fort with the rocket and guards cavalry. Occupy Lacoruna and protect your rocket by the Portugese ship because it can deal serious damage to it. Once on the mainland split your forces: a small force to occupy Lisbon but strong enough to continue on its own and the rest alongside the coast with the fleet. Make sure to occupy the port and prepare for french reinforcements although the ironclad won't move. Once having occupied Lisbon the two spanish generals will have died and only Ferdinand in Madrid will have survived. At that point send your rocket to aid the force in Portugal to occupy Madrid and once you do you get morale boost for 3 turns or so. While doing that the French troops will have strated a slow move but not much so have the rest of your troops soften them up while occupying the port near Bordeaux and kill Exelmans. Soult and Grouchy won't move. Move your main force to occupy Bordeaux and have the troops from Madrid occupy Toulouse. Once all that is done you can easily march to Nantes.</p>
        <li>Road to Hell</li>
        <p>The primary targets are Paris and Lyon. If you take paris at the right time the French will fall. Just let the artillery general go to Frankfurt before you go to attack Paris with 3 generals take the factory in order to build artillery and then surround the capital. Surround Marselle and spam cavalry in order to destroy Austrian troops stationed in the southern area. Take the factory close to Frankfurt and same way as Paris. Take care with the Archduke Charles as he can make kill your infantry and cavalry generals quite easily. And just be patient as artillery can take him out. Troops coming from Nancy-Lyon should gather in Milan.</p>
