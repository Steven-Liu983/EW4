    <h2>Coalition (1792-1815)</h2>
    <ol>                <!-- An ordered list -->
        <li>Fire of Revolution</li>
        <p>At the first turn you should kill the general at Verdun and the nearby artillery unit. Surround the French cavalry general and wipe him out. Move all your troops towards Paris and surround the General.</p>
        <li>Battle of Toulon</li>
        <p>Create a defense line at Marseille by putting your infantry units at the front and your artillery units just behind that. The French will come to you, bomb them first to weaken them and finish them off with your infantry units. After you've killed Napoleon you can leave Marseille to quickly advance through France. Go straight towards the other general and finish him off.</p>
        <li>Chain the Beast</li>
        <p>Capture some farms with your weak infantry unit on Ottoman territory, you are going to need it. With the rest of your fleet immediately head towards Alexandria. Don't pay attention to other French ships. When arrived don't attack the harbour immediately but first surround and destroy the French ships above Alexandria. Once you've done that send all your ships towards the harbour for the final blasts.</p>
        <li>Return to Rhine</li>
        <p>Artillery is key in this campaign, try to recruit them and use this to bomb the French troops. Use the artillery in the South plus the cavalry to attack Munich, bomb it with your artillery and capture Munich with your cavalry once the defending unit is weakened. The French cavalry general at Weilburg is quite powerful, it's worthwhile to take him out using artillery or surrounding with your generals. Once you've taken him out split your troops in two, one half should rush towards Brussels, while the other half can easily capture Weilburg.</p>
        <li>Battle of Trebbia*</li>
        <p>Cross the sea to destroy the coastal artillery, surround and capture Rome. Afterwards head north and capture anything, ignore Genoa first, it's well-defended and not worthwhile to take out immediately. After you've captured Milan split your army in two, one should head to Torino and the other one to Munich. At last you can destroy the battleship in Genoa and capture the harbour.</p>
        <li>Copenhagen Campaign</li>
        <p>Move 3 ships to the north facing the Russian Ships, only attack the red-circled ones. Try to outrange the Privateer and surround the stronger ships. Once done with this operation, move your ships back to the Danish territory. Your other army in the baltics should wipe out the Prussian (and Danish) coastal artilleries and move on to the Danish territory. Surround and destroy the Danish general in the south, even though he isn't a target. Afterwards, destroy the other Danish coastal forts. Your 3 ships at the left should wipe out the coastal artillery and then try to capture the harbour at all costs. You got enough money to build a strong ship at the harbour and use that to hold your ground until the other ships are gathered.</p>
        <li>Battle of Trafalgar</li>
        <p>Use Nelson to attack Villeneuve's ship, flank the enemy so that greater damage can be inflicted. After Villeneuve is defeated, flank and destroy his squadron, then send the remaining ships of your squadron to help Collingwood. Use Collingwood and the battleship in front of him to engage the Spanish battleship next to Cisneros.</p>
        <li>Battle of Austerilitz</li>
        <p>Strengthen the defense around Austeritz and Budapest, artillery is useful for this purpose. After a dozen turns or so the Prussian will launch a full-scale assault, that's when you seize your chance and attack at the same time so now the French have two fronts to fight. Focus on Vienna and take it, the French should have stopped attacking Austerlitz once the Prussians are fully engaged.</p>
        <li>Fury of Prussia</li>
        <p>Have Sophia (on light artillery at the start), Blucher, and Scharnhorst head south to Munich, and make sure that they kill the enemy general that is attacking Jena in their way. Golitsyn on the guards cavalry will join Ferdinand to reinforce Jena. If you had more generals, then I would tell you to reinforce Wesbaden but that won't work for only Golitsyn. To defend Oldenburg, create heavy artillery when you can afford it at the factory and have the light cavalry unit go up there. Oldenburg will probably be taken anyway, but you can retake it using the artillery and cavalry. Do whatever you can to keep the enemy generals away from Jena. Building forts in choke points is the best way to do this, as well as using your generals to body block the enemy. After capturing Munich, the trio mentioned above will move on to the next objective directly in front of Munich before heading up to Karlshure. At this point, Lannes will begin attacking the previously captured objectives. Use tier-3 light infantry to keep him occupied until Ney and the other guy are dead, then use artillery to kill him. Finally, Moreau will start attacking, but can easily be brought down by what's left of Blucher, Golitsyn, and Ferdinand.</p>
        <li>Battle of Eylau</li>
        <p>Focus on occupying Warsaw whether it's in Prussian or French command, slowly kill all the French generals including Napoleon if he comes to you, completely ignore Danzig at the beginning and take it in the end, keep creating guards and keep destroying all the cannons that come across, for generals if your generals are low in health then surround and kill with your other units.</p>
        <li>Gunboat War</li>
        <p>Assign Sophia to the rocket and Golitsyn to the battleship. Concentrate on taking out privateer and place Sophia behind the fleets. Focus on your target as the enemy would not really try to capture the ports. Make sure Wellesley lands as quickly as possible and flank Fischer. Upgrade the cities to make sure that you can build compulsory units to defend your ports.</p>
        <li>Never Surrender</li>
        <p>Play defensively in the north. Try to hold Burgos until the British troops come. Attack from the south. Capture Albacete and the industry nearby. From there, build artillery to bombard Madrid. If you have Sophia, use her to take out the forts near Madrid. If your generals are not strong, avoid taking Madrid directly. Just use artillery. While you are sieging on Madrid with artillery, send other generals to take Zaragoza. If you have trouble fighting French generals then just ignore them, focus on taking targeted towns. Use line infantry to defend the towns.</p>
        <li>Assault on French</li>
        <p>Put Golitsyn on the armored car, defend against Poland. Assault on Munich, but from there inch slowly toward France. Without artillery generals, it might be tough. Keep Golitsyn healthy or give him a snare drum and he'll rip the French troops to shreds. Make sure to build enough farms so you don't run out of food.</p>
        <li>Emperor's Fall*</li>
        <p>Don't just randomly go north to assualt the French. Try to form one pact and head to the left with it. From the left you should go to the right. Use infantry as a shield and slowly bomb them out. If you can afford it, try to use some artillery on the right early on to bombard the hostile generals. So stay within one big group and go left to right, try to outrange the enemy units with artillery and try to surround them.</p>
        <li>The Liberation of Rhine</li>
        <p>Use the light artillery and the guards cavalry to get Brunswick and hold it defensively. Light cavalry and Blucher against Munich. And pretty much in the middle defend against the German attack, push forward, and the defend against the French attack.</p>
        <li>Battle of Waterloo</li>
        <p>Play defensively at Amsterdam to defeat Napoleon and Ney, then take Waterloo and Brussels. Rally troops to the north of Paris (also join with those from Britain) and destroy the fort, ignore Mets for now. Leave small troops (militia or line infantry) to defend Waterloo and Brussels. Bombard Paris with artillery, put infantry or cavalry there to defend the artillery. Important thing is to do this slowly and patiently. Do not advance too quickly. If you happen to capture the stable south of Paris then spam horses from there. But if you don't have gold to spam horse, do not take it before Paris since you would need to spend troops defend it. Once you captured Paris, you probably need to spend a bit of time defending it from French troops from the West. Attack Nancy when you have resource to do so. Finally, move south to attack Murat and take the city.</p>
        <li>War of Glory</li>
        <p>Take Paris as quickly as you can. This should not be difficult since are weakened right at the start. Send some troops to get rid of Marmont (commanding the rocket). Move your troops on the upper left corner east (except ships) and land in the north of Paris. Just ignore what Paget says about their rear. Use your 3 ships to attack and capture Brest and another port near Bordeaux. From there, you can attack Bordeaux with your ships. Don't kill the unit station there; leave him with a bit of life point otherwise AI will sprawn a new unit. While waiting, your troops around Paris should be defending the French attacks. When your troops join near Paris, move south and capture Nancy, Dijon, Lyon along the way. This is to avoid the fortresses. From Lyon, you can take Marseille and attack Napoleon from southeast. Mountains there offer you some cover so fighting Napoleon will not be too bad. While you are busy with Napoleon, you can send a fast moving unit to take Bordeaux where your ship are standing by for destroying the troop there.</p>
