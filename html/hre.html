    <h2>Holy Rome Empire (1807-1822)</h2>
    <ol>                <!-- An ordered list -->
        <li>Confederation of the Rhine</li>
        <p>Send one of your strongest general to help defend Dresden, artillery is recommended. Go westward and destroy the artillery and the heavy fort using surrounding tactics. Use your ship as a support, capture everything for the gold. Afterwards slowly head south using artillery to wipe out the strong French-alligned units, don't pay attention to the fortress in the south, capture Stuttgart at last.</p>
        <li>Legacy of the Empire</li>
        <p>Defend in the west against Bavaria as they will attack Vienna. Just keep your units in cities over there to heal up. Use an artillery general near Belgrade to capture it and protect it from Ottoman. If you have a cavalry general, use him to either capture the Wallachian objective or defend Belgrade if your artillery general isn't enough. For the northern objective, just wait for Russia to weaken the general that's there and steal the city. When you have Belgrade and Kishinev then you can start attacking Munich. If you have any generals left, use them here.</p>
        <li>Austro-Turkish War</li>
        <p>Use Kate on light artillery to defend Munich for a few turns, Sophia on heavy artillery to capture Debrecen, and Fatimah in Vienna for income. This mission is just a really fast speed mission. First, capture Debrecen with your units while Radetzky captures Belgrade. Send 2 or 3 units to the Russians and take their town/factory so that you can defend them. After capturing Belgrade Radetzky defends it with Archduke J. Then your troops that captured Debrecen move on to the final objective.</p>
        <li>Battle of Lutzen</li>
        <p>Assign Golitsyn on light cav, Murat on guards cav, Sophia on rocket, built light artillery then assign marmont. Move Clausewitz and grenadier to defend Berlin. Sophia forward into Berlin to take fort near Brunswick. Move Murat and Scharnost in front of your fort along with your Triple guards. March Blucher forward and your light cavalry (Golitsyn) to Prague. Focus on destroy fort near Frankfurt but take Brunswick first for avoiding some artillery spam from the enemy. Surround Ney with Blucher, Golitsyn and Murat also bombard him with Scharnost amd Marmont. Kill Ney first then take on Napoleon. At round 5, your troops will gain some confidence. After the emperor is killed, enemy morale will drop. More advantage, try to take Frankfurt there as Massena nor Grouchy will come close by. Kill Massena first after taking Frankfurt. Ignore other troops just do your objective. Killing him will cost around 2 turn this included bombard by Scharnost, Sophia and Marmont. Kill Grouchy after that, note that Marmont (French general) will march to Frankfurt along with troops with him.</p>
        <li>Return to Italy</li>
        <p>Split troops into two - one attack Milan in the north and another attack Naples in the south. Leave Rome for now. For attacking Milan, do not rush, wait for Fontanelli to advance beyond Italian fort range then kill him. Destroy the fort before attacking Balabio and MacDonald. After you eliminate those two Milan is easy to take by artillery since Eugene is likely to just siting in the city. Once Milan is taken, play defensively there and save resources for building troops in the south. In the south, if you have Sophia, let her command siege artillery. She'll blow all the forts on your way into pieces in no time. If you don't then let your other artillery general take the job. This will make things much easier. When coastal forts are cleared, utilize ships to help attacking land units from afar. Your troops, then, land on the south Italy and take a city and a stable. In the meantime, move your ships around Italian peninsula to the west side. J.Bonaparte is also sitting in Naples waiting for your cannonballs. If you take the fort in the north of Naples out earlier, you can safely build artillery unit from the industry there. Once you capture Naples, divide your troops into two. One attack Rome another take the port near Cagliari. Taking the port should not be difficult because it is guarded a privateer and you have your ships from before to support. If your ships aint in good shape, you can also build more from a port near Naples. Taking Rome can be troublesome because of Murat and Augereau. This also depends on AI, sometimes, they move north and if that is the case then you would have more trouble there instead. Regardless, you should not have too much trouble since what you need to do is to take the city. If you cannot defeat them then ignore them and focus on taking Rome. If Murat is defending Rome then use artillery.</p>
        <li>Battle of the Nations</li>
        <p>First take Dresden, then focus all forces to take Frankfurt, leave militia or line infantry to defend Berlin. The Dutch can almost be ignored since their attack can be easily defended with a few cheap units. You may consider not taking Brunswick because your troop station there will be hit by the nearby fort. The Austrians will take care of Munich. You may send a few units there when Franuemont is weakend to make sure that you are the one who capture it. At Frankfurt, play defensively and destroy approaching French troops. If you can capture Karlsruhe, defending will be much easier because enemies will be force to either cross the river to Frankfurt or go through Karlsruhe. Whichever the case you can spam artillery from the nearby industry to bombard the French from the distance. Just keep killing french troops (including Augereau, Napoleon, and Murat) until you are confident that you can push forward to take Metz and Nancy. When you capture Metz and Nancy, at this stage, you probably have no problem taking Paris and finish the mission.</p>
        <li>Unification of Germany</li>
        <p>Use your artillery general on the rocket artillery near Poland to take Warsaw. Don't leave him in the range of Dombrowski as he will move to attack and deal massive damage. Have your cavalry general on the heavy cavalry next to Berlin attack Saxony with Blucher. Have the last Prussian general capture the Austrian factory. If you have another artillery general, put him on light artillery to help out in Poland.</p>
        <li>Reconstruction of the Empire</li>
        <p>Get Switzerland guarded by some artillery, then make a huge army of 3/4 of your army and crush into the Prussian main line. Use your cavalry general, some artillery and line infantry to capture warsaw and Lviv, keep spamming line infantries to keep Poland busy. Crush through the Prussian lines with your main force and split a bit up: send 1 or 2 units to the Switzerland army to take that city and Zurich, then roll into Berlin and Danzig.</p>
        <li>Attack the French</li>
        <p>First take Amsterdam for the money and other resourse, try to avoid Nancy/Metz because of the strong troops and bunkers standing there. Instead go via Brussel towards Paris and afterwards towards Nantes. Try to bomb the general in Paris out with a strong general. Your troops in the south should be able to conquer the stable.</p>
        <li>Invasion of Peninsular</li>
        <p>Assign the infantry general to the tier-3 granedier in the south, the cavalry general to the armored car and the artillery general to the heavy artillery. Keep the fleet at home, build a coastal fort near the port. Rush against the French troops so the eastern Spanish troops do not retaliate. Take the French village north of Madrid killing Suchet and Drouot fairly easily with artillery and cavalry. Do not bother about the Spanish west of it because they would not move (except Diez). Then move south to Madrid blasting it with your artillery. Getting in position is tricky because of rivers and fort. Sended the infantry general and Blucher south of the fort to Madrid. Then send the cavalry and infantry general to Seville, and the artillery general plus the infantry and cavalry to Lisbon.</p>
        <li>Continental system</li>
        <p>Securing Denmark is your first order of business. Archduke C. and Fatimah on the armored car with some soldiers would be enough. While this happened, Radetzky defended the west from landing troops while Sophia protected Amsterdam from enemy generals. Don't bother trying to keep the ports as they are too difficult to defend. After capturing Denmark's land leave their port unoccupied and use Radetzky to capture the westernmost port after 1. Landing generals have been killed. 2. The western battleship general has extended to Rotterdam. From there assign Kate to a battleship and use the generals and Sophia to attack the enemy battleships.</p>
        <li>Battle of Britain*</li>
        <p>Focus the attack on the east of London. Use land unit to destroy few coastal forts in the east, then use ships to harass the British land units. This should not be difficult since you have a lot of ships at the beginning but the timing is important. If you land in Britain too fast, before the ships can give fire support then your landing forces might be overwhelmed.</p>
        <li>Balkan Wars</li>
        <p>Try to put all your troops towards Sofia (use Golistyn), don't pay attention to the Ottoman cities to the left of it. Keep a line infantry in Debrechen so it won't be conquered. After this, conquer the factory of Sofia and create a heavy artillery. Assign your best artillery general on it and bomb out the Ottoman general on Istanbul, while focusing your main army on Russia. After this you have to land in Asian Turkey to conquer Bursa. Assign another general nearby Debrechen or Sofia, since a bunch of Ottoman troops will try to conquer it back.</p>
        <li>Expedition to North Africa*</li>
        <p>Upgrading cities is key in this campaign, its really important to have a great economy for this one. Use your battleships as a support for your units. Only attack Turkey in the beginning, move your grecian units to the front as well. Keep upgrading your cities untill you reach Konya, use artillery to wipe out the Ottoman generals. After you reached Konya you've established a good economy. Split your army into two, one for Egypt and one for the east.</p>
        <li>North America Landings</li>
        <p>Bring everybody south and secure the objective there and all the other cities around it for income. From there use your general on the armored car to capture the other objective. Drummond and Sophia were enough to kill Hull. The general in the armored car stayed in Charlotte until he gained enough health to attack Cleveland. Everybody else pushed to Washington, capturing things on the way. Washington is the hardest part because there are a lot of troops there. You will want to hold the line with your troops until Sophia and Drummond arrive, and when they do you can attack Washington. You don't really have to worry about keeping Collingwood alive as long as he is there to fight the American ships. From Washington use everything you have to attack Jackson.</p>
