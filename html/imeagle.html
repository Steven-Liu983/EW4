    <h2>Imperial Eagle (1798-1820)</h2>
    <ol>                <!-- An ordered list -->
        <li>Siege of Toulon</li>
        <p>You don't need anything to defend Bordeaux, so move those units away towards Toulon, ignore Bordeaux. You got a ship that outranges the british ship at Toulon, so use that to wipe the ship out. Move all your troops towards Marseille and surround and capture it, capture Toulon with your ship and you're finished.</p>
        <li>Italy War</li>
        <p>Ignore the British ships in the south, use your own to assist you in the battle. Destroy the artillery at Torino first before dealing with the general, bombard the general with Napoleon and surround him with the rest of your troops and kill him. Once you've taken Torino head east and surround and destroy Milan and capture it, use Napoleon to wipe out the strong units of the enemy.</p>
        <li>Siege of Mantua</li>
        <p>First head east and capture Milan. Afterwards, use your infantry general to destroy the hostile artillery unit, use your artillery general (Napoleon) + artillery units to destroy the hostile infantry general, and surround the fort and destroy it. After you destroyed the fort head south and surround and destroy the hostile cavalry general. Your troops in the north should surround and destroy the hostile artillery general.</p>
        <li>Egyptian Expedition</li>
        <p>Use Marmont and Napoleon and the navy to flank and attack Sidney's frigate and attack Pasha's Line Infantry. Capture Alexandria with naval attacks, land quickly and capture the farms. Use Desaix to demoralize the enemy and capture Cairo.</p>
        <li>Conquer the North Africa*</li>
        <p>For Tripoli, send one infantry and one frigate down there and decreasae the general's HP in there, and then send in the line infantry. Make sure to avoid the coastal fort nearby and seize the port to bombard it. For Sicily take the grenadier and battleship and repeat what you do in Tripoli and then take it back to Tunisia. Take Savary and Marmont only and take the Stable and then Tunisia. Then focus on the factory and spam light artillery towards Algeria. First fend your group from Agha's initial squadron and then seize the city.</p>
        <li>Battle of Marengo</li>
        <p>The army in the south should not go immediately into battle. Focus on Torino and Milano. Keep your cannons ready. Now put some line infantry around it. The first target will attack it, surround him with everything you got and annihilate his army. Do not go and kill Radetzky, he will come to you. Just shoot with all your cannons, surround him, flank him, kill him. Your northern army has to focus on Deroy (I think that is the name of the upper gen), take Munich with some help of Southern army.</p>
        <li>Battle of Three Emperors</li>
        <p>Send all troops along the Danube River, taking out troops along the way. Protect Soult and Davout, your two artillery generals – you’ll need them later to take Vienna and Brunn and eliminate Kutuzov and Bagration. You can have some fun using an artillery from Brunswick to bombard the Prussian troops directly east of Oldenburg if you want. By around round 6, you can be in a position to surround or at least flank Vienna. Coalition forces will make a defensive line running through Brunn, Austerlitz, and the Austrian fort. By round 7, Prussia may send a few troops due south – not much of a problem, but this is also when Russian reinforcements will start to arrive… fortunately, not all at once. When you take Buda and/or Pest the Austrian cavalry in the south will counterattack, so finish taking Vienna first, even if those cities are unoccupied. About round 11, the troops to the east and northeast of Pest will attack, as well. Bear in mind that none of all these troops need to be killed except for the southern cavalry general. At this point, it becomes a slugfest between your line stretching from Buda and Pest northwestward through Vienna and Austerlitz up to the lone factory, and the latter half of the Russian reinforcements and Austrian counterattack. It’ll be brutal, because by now your generals will be very weak, but hold the line and keep building artillery at both ends – you’ll need it against Bagration in particular. Bombard Brunn when you have no other target – Leiberich won’t budge from that spot. Retreat back across the river only if you have to, but hold the lone factory, Buda, Pest, and especially Vienna at all costs. By denying them those cities, you deny them front-line reinforcements. Block with infantry, hit with artillery, and their forces will run out of steam. Austerlitz is useful for pumping out cheap militia (or infantry, if you upgrade it) – they’ll waste time trying to take it while you blast them!</p>
        <li>Battle of Jena</li>
        <p>Use Murat to rescue Ney; focus on the cavalry to Ney's left. Use Napoleon and Davout to take Dresden and move to pressure Jena, and use Augerau to take Brunswick. Use ships to take out the cavalry unit in Kiel. Once Ney recovers from confusion, pull him back to Dresden and let him rest there. Take Jena, and send Murat towards Berlin to take out the fort. Send Augerau towards Berlin to provide support, and split his army to send a unit or two towards Oldenburg as well. Use ships to take out the Danish port. Pull back and consolidate near Jena, which will most likely fall. Start producing guards at Dresden, and fight a war of attrition against the Prussians. Use Augerau to capture Oldenburg, then send him to capture Kiel. Napoleon should probably fall back towards Wiesbaden by this point, since he should be low. He can return to the battlefield once he has about half the HP later. Davout will likely be the main source of firepower at this point. Move ships down the Kattegat, take out the coast artillery. Verdun, Wiesbaden, and Dresden should all be upgraded to Tier-6 cities by this point, as well as whatever upgrades that were invested in Oldenburg/Jena. Take Jena, continue pushing Northwards towards Berlin, use Murat to take out the fort to the right. Start producing light artillery at Brunswick, and move the Guard production from Dresden to Jena. Russians should have started, or have already landed by this point. Send Augerau back into Germany, take out the Russian artillery if possible. Let him play a bit until your main army is in range of Berlin. Circle ships around Copenhagen towards the Baltic Sea, then attempt to use them to bombard enemy units near the coast. Attempt to let the Russian armies flank the left of the main army, so they free up valuable space that can be used to encircle Berlin.</p>
        <li>Prussia Counterattack</li>
        <p>Use the large fortress as a divider between your northern army and southern army: put your artillery general on the siege artillery. Put your cavalry general on the heavy cavalry unit. Use your northern army to defend against the advancing Prussian guards cavalry and grenadiers. Once your northern army is locked in conflict, move the general in the north to link up woth your southern group, then advance your southern group towards Krakow. After you take Krakow you have two choices: either rush to Warsaw and take it then make a stand, or defend Krakow until there are few Russians left. Try to do this quickly because the Russians will move to defend Warsaw.</p>
        <li>Peninsular War</li>
        <p>Take Burgos (in the north) first and play defensively at Madrid. After Burgos is captured, move the troops in Madrid to the south to attack Seville. The number of Spanish troops in the south should be fewer by then since they had tried to attack Madrid and were annihilated. Around turn 12 Wellesley will land in the northwest, use the troops at Burgos to destroy his. You don't need to attack the Portuguese, you only have to capture Burgos, Seville, and destroy Wellesley's troop. In addition, it is a very good idea to upgrade at least one farm on the very first turn. Then you can almost forget about supply problem for the rest of the game.</p>
        <li>Battle of Wagram</li>
        <p>Have MacDonald head to Vienna while everyone else attacks the enemy generals. After taking Vienna, focus on dealing with the enemy general. Flank Archduke Charles to decrease his morale and take him down.</p>
        <li>Expedition Russia</li>
        <p>Put Napoleon on the front-line rocket artillery, and put Murat on the guards cavalry. Put Lannes on the rank 3 guard infantry as well. Have them go to the front-line as quickly as possible, capturing Polish farms on the way there. While you wait for them, have Napoleon start bombarding the general in Minsk along with Davout while Murat defends them from enemy soldiers. Once your generals reach the front, attack Kiev right above Minsk. After defeating the general there, move on to Smolenks. If you moved quickly, then the incoming fire attack won't affect you as it will happen behind you. From Smolenks go around Kutuzov so that he doesn't damage you and attack Moscow with everything you have.</p>
        <li>The Retreat of the Empire</li>
        <p>Bring all the units to defend Moscow, then recapture the southern cities. After that, send a small force to assist Blucher in killing the general over there, and a bigger force south to face Bagration, Dombrowski from Poland might help you if you are lucky.</p>
        <li>Leipzig Campaign</li>
        <p>First, you need to focus on capture Stuttgart and Dresden. Use Marmont and infantries around there to attack Stuttgart, and send Murat and Napoleon attack Dresden. You may wait for those in Paris to join force before pressing forward if you are not confident. MacDonald can be on either Stuttgart or Dresden front as you see fit. Both fronts are near anyway. Upgrade Leipzig to either at least lv 2 or 3 so you can build line infantry to guard the town. Early phase, just having one line infantry sitting there is enough. Only need to watch out for Prussian cavalry which can kill and take the town in one round. Leave Berlin alone and stay away from the fort range. Stuttgart is not difficult to capture. Once you are done, send those troops to help taking Dresden. The Bavarian should be fine defending Munich by themselves so no need to worry. Once you capture Dresden, all you have to do is to defend the city. This will be difficult since the Austrian and Russian will be pouring in like flood. By now the situation at Leipzig should be dire because Blutcher would lead the Prussian there himself. You can send Murat to help with the situation. Actually, Murat's main job at Dresden is to destroy the fort there so once he finishes, others can take care the rest and he's free to go to leipzig. Having a formation of line infantry sitting in Leipzig is really helpful here. An important thing is that if a general's health is low and not likely to survive the next round, move him out and build a new one to avoid the city being captured by cavalry or being circled. Artillery and, especially, rocket launcher are very useful for taking out Prussian forces attacking Leipzig. By around round 12, Bennigsen will come out to attack Dresden. The worst thing is a horde of Austrian artillery. But what you really need to do at this point is just to defeat Blutcher and Bennigsen. You can spam artillery from the factory near Dresden to fire on Bennigsen given that you have some troops to cover them up.</p>
        <li>Coalition Disruption</li>
        <p>Focus your main forces on the British first. Don't attack the Prussians (Frankfurt) at the very begining - it will take 6-7 rounds for them to start acting. Use your ship to stop the rocket artillery coming from England. Try to assign two artillery generals for heavy & light artillery, your best infantry general for guards in Paris. You also have 2 heavy cavalry for assigning cavalry generals. That should be more than enough to smash the British forces. Use artillery for the strongest enemy infantry generals, so they can't counterattack. Don't forget to maneuver while attacking in order to decrease the morale of the enemy troops.</p>
        <li>Invasion of Britain</li>
        <p>Engage the British fleet under Sydney command. Fight defensively, avoid damage by hiding behind the Spanish fleet. In the east, move all the units from Amsterdam to join with your main force north of Paris. Jervis's fleet will attack Amsterdam. Do not try to defeat them. Just defend Amsterdam with line infantry and coastal forts. Try to take out the landing units because it's them, not Jervis, that can come and take Amsterdam. Watch out for the guard cavalry as it can kill and capture the city. If your line infantry has low health then move him out and train a new one. Gather all of your troops to the north of Paris. This includes units that originally station in Amsterdam, Nantes and the artillery near Brest. Move these troops on land along the northern coast. If they get into the sea they will be attacked by ships. Wait until all of your troops are assembled in the north of Paris before start crossing the English Channel. While waiting you can use a ship at Lehavre to attack on British guard cavalry at Southampton. But do not kill the unit just leave him barely alive. Land on the coast of Britain starting from Southampton to the west coast of London. Most of Jervis fleet should be occupied at Amsterdam so you won't have a hard time landing.</p>
        <li>North America I</li>
        <p>Send the navy (Kate on the Battleship) and Grenadiers to New York. The ships can annihilate Dearborn, allowing the Grenadiers in, which draws Jackson into the battle. Fatimah (on guards cavalry), light infantry, and light artillery defend from Jervis with the help of coastal forts. The rest of the army can destroy Paget, while the artillery bombards Sidney and his support, with Sebastiani's armored cars moving in for the kill. Then Marmont and Oudinot take on Cotton, while the rest beat up Rowland.</p>
        <li>North America II*</li>
        <p>Put Picton on the guards that are on land. Use Grouchy and Ney the same way you have been using them. Since you have only 3 generals, have everybody attack Washington. Make sure you have only your artillery fight the generals on machine guns as they will do 80-100 damage. And deal with any attacking generals before you capture Washington because the guy in there doesn't move. After you have Washington, have Ney go to Cleveland. If you don't think he can do it by himself, send Picton or Mortier with him. While they do that, the rest of your army goes to the last objective. The Indians aren't a problem as they usually are killed by the US.</p>
